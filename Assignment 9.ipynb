    "    \n",
    "When an existing file is opened in write mode (mode='w'), the following consequences occur :\n",

    "1.) Truncation : The file is truncated, which means all existing content in the file is deleted and the file size becomes 0. If \n",

    "\n",
    "2.) File Pointer : The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file, ready to write new content. Any write operations\n",
    "    performed will overwrite the existing data or append new data at the beginning of the file, depending on the specific write\n",
    "    operation used.\n",

    "usual dictionary operations like __getitem__ (using square brackets), __setitem__ (using assignment), __delitem__ (deletion),\n",
    "and iterating over keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike an in-memory dictionary, a shelf object persists its data on disk, typically as a file. It uses Python's \n",
    "pickle module to serialize objects and store them in the file, allowing us to store and retrieve complex Python objects.\n",

    "    print(s[\"key3\"])  # Output: {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 25}\n",

    "In this example, the shelf behaves like a dictionary, allowing us to store and retrieve values using keys. However, the actual\n",
